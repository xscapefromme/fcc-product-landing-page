good practice of building a real site with more practice using css. still need a lot more practice/experience but slowly getting there. Understanding and everything starting to click just a few grey areas and looking forward to learning backend. 

- learned a lot in the overall structiring of building a more responsive website. Everything starting to click and looking forward to building more websites and getting deeper such as the backend.
- Proud that I was able to build a basic website and its only up from here. Started with the header, used display flex so they were on their own row then each new content was a new section that I described. Nothing I learned was *new* but all just refinement and getting more experience.
- Was able to understand the max-width more used media queries for repsonsiveness based on screen size and started out as mobile first as that was the simplist for me to start off with.
- Something I struggled was again how was I was going to structure it as I haven't worked on a full website with a header and footer really before but started to understand and over time started to get momentum.
- I did learned about the iframe and how to embed a youtube video which was cool. Used aspect ratio to keep it responsive.

- Things that I need to constantly improve on is really just proper structing. I understand how it works just starting out is a little slow but over time slowly getting faster. Its just more like whats more effiecnt in laying out the layout and how to do it properly semantically and visually. 
- Also realizing that the element is going to take 100% full width if you set it width: 100% and add a max-width to let it know when to stop. Use margin: 0 auto to center it relative to the page.
